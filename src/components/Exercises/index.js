    <p className='para'><span className='span-item'>Back: Farmer’s Walk & Trap Bar Carry</span><br/>

    
    Farmer’s Walk: This workout may sound silly, but the results are anything but. All you need to do is stand up straight and start walking with some heavy dumbbells in each hand. It’s that simple! Utilize the farmer’s walk as either a warm-up exercise or as a brutal finisher.

Trap Bar Walk: The trap bar carry, while similar to the farmer’s walk, allows you to carry a whole lot more weight. Besides the gear, the workouts are essentially the same: Load your trap bar with a heavy weight, stand inside, lift it up, and start walking.  <a href='https://www.muscleandfitness.com/workouts/back-exercises/how-t-bar-row/' rel="noopener noreferrer">check out this article.</a></p>
